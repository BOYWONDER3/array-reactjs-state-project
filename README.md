1. Create state that stores an array with the initial value of ["A", "B", "C"]
2. Add the ability to remove the first element from the array
3. Add the ability to remove a specific letter from the array
4. Add the ability to add a new element to the start of the array
5. Add the ability to add a new element to the end of the array
6. Add the ability to clear the array
7. Add the ability to reset the array to the initial value
8. Add the ability to update all A elements in the array to H
9. Add an input that is connected to state and a button that will add the input value to the start of the array
10. Add the ability to add a new element at any index in the array
