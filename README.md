# The main purpose of this project is to understand how Arrays work with useState in Recactjs and I'm going to implement some functionality in this project using different Array methods. these functionalities include 

1. Create state that stores an array with the initial value of ["A", "B", "C"]

2. Add the ability to remove the first element from the array: using the .slice(1) array method

3. Add the ability to remove a specific letter from the array: using the .filter() array method

4. Add the ability to add a new element to the start of the array: can't use the .push() method due to immutuability, instead we use the spread operator to create a new set of array

5. Add the ability to add a new element to the end of the array: same as task 4 above

6. Add the ability to clear the array: 

7. Add the ability to reset the array to the initial value
8. Add the ability to update all A elements in the array to H
9. Add an input that is connected to state and a button that will add the input value to the start of the array
10. Add the ability to add a new element at any index in the array
